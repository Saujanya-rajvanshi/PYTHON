###### history of PYTHON
# 🎗 HISTORY
Python is one of the most popular, high-level, general-purpose programming languages. It was created with a focus on code readability and allows developers to write concepts in fewer lines compared to C++ or Java.

* Who Invented Python? <br>
**Creator :** Guido van Rossum <br>
**Started :** 1989, at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Netherlands <br>
**First Release :** 1991 <br>
**Reason :** Started as a hobby project during Christmas holidays <br>
**Predecessor :** Inspired by the ABC language, but Guido improved it by fixing its limitations <br>

* Why is it called Python? <br>
Named after the BBC comedy series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” <br>
Guido wanted a name that was short, unique, and a little mysterious <br>
He served as Python’s BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) until 2018 <br>
Worked at Google and later at Dropbox <br>

* Evolution of Python
When first released, Python already supported: <br>
Classes with inheritance <br>
Core data types <br>
Exception handling <br>
Functions <br>

* Key Versions: <br>
Python 2.x → Popular for many years, but now outdated <br>
Python 3.x → Current standard, actively developed <br>
Latest Version: Python 3.12.1 (as of now) <br>
